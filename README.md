# 🚀 Deploying AWS EC2 using Terraform & GitHub Actions  

## 📝 Overview  
This project automates the provisioning of an **AWS EC2 instance** using **Terraform** and **GitHub Actions CI/CD**. It eliminates manual setup by leveraging **OIDC authentication** for secure AWS access, allowing seamless deployment without long-lived credentials. The workflow initializes Terraform, plans infrastructure changes, and applies them to deploy an EC2 instance with a configured security group for SSH and HTTP access.
